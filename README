📚 Study Flow Choreography App
--------------------------------

📝 Problem Statement:
Students often struggle with structuring their study time effectively. 
They either overwork without breaks, forget to review, or lack motivation. 
This leads to poor retention and burnout. 
There is a need for a simple, guided tool that helps students balance 
planning, studying, taking breaks, and reviewing.

💡 How This Prototype Solves the Problem:
This web app provides a clear "Study Flow Choreography":
    1. Plan → Define your study session goals.
    2. Study → Focus mode with guidance.
    3. Break → Timed breaks to recharge.
    4. Review → Quick revision for better retention.

The prototype gives students a visually structured study assistant with 
a modern UI. It also includes optional chatbot integration (e.g. GPT or 
free alternatives like Ollama/HuggingFace) to provide AI-powered study help.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used:
- Python 3 (Flask framework) → Backend web server
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript → Frontend UI
- OpenAI API (optional, GPT integration – pending free alternative API)
- Can be extended with HuggingFace API or Ollama for free chatbot support

✅ Status:
Frontend + Flask backend prototype working.  
Only pending task: integrate a free chatbot API (instead of OpenAI GPT).
